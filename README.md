Twitter Bot for Makura Bot

This is a simple node.js engine for twitter, posting to the account @ThePillowBot. 

The Pillow Book (Makura no soshi) is a Japanese classic from the Heian Era (10th Century), written by Sei Shonagon. It comprises a series of observations and anecdotes of the Sei Shonagon's life in the imperial court. One common format in this miscellany is a set of lists - things which should be large, things which appear large but are small, splendid things, and so on. 

This bot creates lists inspired by The Pillow Book using a nearley grammar parser (https://nearley.js.org/docs/getting-started) and the NPM module Nearley-Unparse (https://www.npmjs.com/package/nearley-unparse).
